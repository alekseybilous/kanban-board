## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure

We chose Nx for its powerful monorepo capabilities, enabling:

- Shared code and dependencies
- Consistent build and test processes
- Efficient caching and incremental builds
- Clear dependency graph management

### Theme System

Custom CSS properties provide:

- Runtime theme switching without JavaScript
- Better performance than CSS-in-JS solutions
- Easy customization and extension
- Consistent design tokens across applications

### Component Architecture

Radix UI foundation ensures:

- Accessibility compliance out of the box
- Unstyled primitives for design flexibility
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Robust behavior patterns
