# Getting Started

Welcome to our Design System! This comprehensive guide will help you understand and implement our design system in your projects.

## 🎯 What is a Design System?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. Our design system includes:

- **Foundation** - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- **Components** - Reusable UI components
- **Themes** - Visual variations and dark/light modes
- **Patterns** - Common UI patterns and layouts
- **Guidelines** - Best practices and usage recommendations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Design System

```bash
npm install @your-org/design-system @your-org/theme
```

### 2. Import Base Styles

```tsx
import '@your-org/theme/css';
```

### 3. Use Components

```tsx
import { Button } from '@your-org/design-system';

function App() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Get Started</Button>;
}
```

### 4. Apply a Theme

```tsx
// Set theme on your app root
<div data-theme="light">
  <App />
</div>
```
