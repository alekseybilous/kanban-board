# Kanban Board Design System

Welcome to the **Kanban Board Design System** documentation! This Storybook serves as the central hub for all reusable UI components, design tokens, and development guidelines used across our modern task management application.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Kanban Board is a comprehensive task management solution built with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and maintainable code architecture. Our application provides:

- **Visual Task Organization** - Intuitive Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Modern User Experience** - Clean, responsive design with multiple theme support
- **Scalable Architecture** - Monorepo structure for maintainable, reusable code
- **Accessibility First** - WCAG compliant components and inclusive design
- **Developer Experience** - Full TypeScript support, automated testing, and consistent tooling

## 🏗️ Monorepo Architecture

Our project follows a well-structured monorepo pattern using **Nx** for efficient development and build processes:

```
kanban-board/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                    # Next.js application (main app)
│   ├── web-e2e/              # End-to-end tests
│   └── storybook-host/       # This Storybook instance
├── packages/
│   ├── theme/                # Design tokens & CSS variables
│   ├── design-system/        # Shared React components
│   └── eslint-config/        # Shared ESLint configurations
└── tools/                    # Build and development tools
```
